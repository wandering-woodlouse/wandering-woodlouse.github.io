Welcome!

Here at An Extraordinary Ordinary Life, I'd like to invite you to take a moment to appreciate the finer things in life with me. Whether that's a warm and well-worn knitted jumper or the way the sunlight filters through the trees, I hope that there's something in my collection that charms and delights you.
