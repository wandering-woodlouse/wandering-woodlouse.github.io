# Who Am I?

I'm Kei, otherwise known as wandering_woodlouse, author of An Extraordinary Ordinary Life.

To make a living, I write code, for actually living, I illustrate. 
Somehow, capturing my simple life has made me realise just how precious and extraordinary living is, and I'd be honoured to share that joy with you!
